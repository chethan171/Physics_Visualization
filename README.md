This project is a 3D visualization tool for demonstrating Physics concepts. The tool uses Python and OpenGL (PyOpenGL) to render the graphics and provide interactive controls.


Technologies Used
1. Python
Language: The project is developed using Python, which is known for its simplicity and readability. Python provides extensive libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for scientific computing, data visualization, and graphical applications.
2. PyOpenGL
Library: PyOpenGL is a cross-platform Python binding to OpenGL, which is a standard specification defining a cross-language, cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics.
Usage: It is used to render 3D graphics for the projectile motion and 4-stroke engine visualizations. PyOpenGL allows the creation of sophisticated graphics with efficient hardware acceleration.
3. pygame
Library: pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries.
Usage: In this project, pygame is used for handling window management, user input (keyboard and mouse), and event handling. It simplifies interaction with the graphical user interface.
4. numpy
Library: numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Usage: numpy is used for numerical calculations, such as computing projectile trajectories and physics calculations for the engine simulation.
Project Structure and Script Explanations
main.py
Purpose: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes the application, sets up the main loop, and handles user interactions.
Technologies Used:
PyOpenGL: For rendering the 3D graphics.
pygame: For creating the window, handling user input, and managing the main loop.
numpy: For handling the mathematical calculations required for projectile motion and engine simulations.
icons/
Purpose: This directory contains all the icons used in the project.
Technologies Used: The icons can be standard image files (e.g., PNG, JPG) used within the UI for buttons, indicators, etc.
scripts/
Purpose: This directory contains all the scripts for the project. Each script is responsible for a specific functionality or component of the application.
Technologies Used:
Physics Calculations: Scripts in this directory might use numpy for calculations related to projectile motion and engine dynamics.
Rendering: Scripts responsible for rendering the 3D graphics will use PyOpenGL.
User Interface: Scripts handling the UI might use pygame for rendering text, handling button clicks, and displaying controls.Contributing
